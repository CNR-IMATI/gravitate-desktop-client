# Groups View

Note: For a general overview of the desktop client interface, go to the
[Overview](overview.md) page

This view is dedicated to the creation and management of groups, which
correspond to the creation of new findings.

The tools available in this view allow to add, modify and delete groups.

Also, it is possible to add textual notes to groups, which are meant to
enrich the description of a set of objects with additional observations.

To start working with groups, right-click on a group (denoted by a
folder icon) and select \"Load Group\". Items in the group will be
loaded in the central panel.

The tools available in this view are the following:

-   **Add note**: creates a new text note
-   **Create Group**: creates a new group
-   **Add to clipboard**: copies the selected item to the Clipboard

## Adding a text note

After clicking the **Add note** button, a new window will open. It is
possible to enter a note in plain text format. Click on the **Save**
button, to save the note in the system.

The note will be added to the current group; it is possible to
manipulate the note as any other object in the Clipboard (e.g. move,
delete it). It is also possible to edit a note by right-clicking on the
note and pressing the \"Edit note\" button
